# Overview

This repository contains an extended lab to build `Food App` a restaurant listing service.

Based on the concepts we have learnt we will gradually implement new features for the app as well as test them with react-testing-library

Each lab consist of 2 branches, the lab branch for implementing your code, and the sample solution branch to be viewed after the lab
